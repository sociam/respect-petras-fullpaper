\begin{abstract}
This is where the abstract should be placed. It should consist of one 
paragraph and a concise summary of the material discussed in the article 
below. It is preferable not to use footnotes in the abstract or the title. 
Acknowledgements for funding organisations etc. are placed in a separate 
section at the end of the text. The text in this abstract is likely to be 
taken directly as it appears and will form the abstract on IETInspec and 
IEEExplore.

\section{Introduction}%1 

The proceedings published for the conference will contain all the accepted 
papers, which have been received by the organiser no later than the 
date specified on the event website. Papers received after that date will 
not be considered for publication. All papers submitted will have undergone 
a rigorous peer review process by the Programme Committee. All reviewers' 
comments are sent to the authors. 


Successful authors will be asked to submit a final camera ready paper for 
publication. Authors are asked to prepare and submit electronic 
versions of their full papers according to these instructions.

\section{Manuscript preparation}%2

Full papers must be typed in English. This instruction page is an example of 
the format and font sizes to be used.

The title of the paper is typed in sentence case (bold 18pt) and centred on 
the page. The author's initials and surname are typed in title case bold 
letters and centred on the page. Directly under the author's name in title 
case letters and also centred is the author's affiliation, address, plus 
email address of (at least) the corresponding author. Manuscripts must be 
typed single spaced using 10 point characters. Only Times, Times Roman, 
Times New Roman and Symbol fonts are accepted. The text must fall within a 
frame of 18\,cm$\,{\times}\,$24\,cm centred on an A4 page (21\,cm$\,{\times}\,$29.7\,cm). Paragraphs 
are separated by 6 points and with no indentation. The text of the full 
papers is written in two columns and justified. Each column has a width of 
8.8 cm and the columns are separated by a margin of 0.4\,cm. Your paper must 
adhere to the length stipulated on the event website. Pages should be 
numbered centrally at the bottom of the page. 

\subsection{Figures and tables}%2.1

Figures and tables should be centred in the column, numbered consecutively 
throughout the text, and each should have a caption underneath it (see for 
example Table 1). Care should be taken that the lettering is not too small. 
All figures and tables should be included in the electronic versions of the 
full paper. 

\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centerline{\begin{tabular}{|p{20pt}|p{20pt}|}\hline
$n$& $n$! \\\hline
1 \newline 2 \newline 3& 1 \newline 2 \newline6 \\\hline
\end{tabular}}
\caption{This is an example of a table caption.}%Table 1: 
\label{tab1}
\end{table}

\subsection{Equations}%2.2 

Equations should be typed within the text, centred, and should be numbered 
consecutively throughout the text. They should be referred to in the text as 
Equation (n). Their numbers should be typed in parentheses, flush right, as 
in the following example.
\begin{equation}% (1)
\rm PA + A'P - PBR^{-1} B'P + Q = 0.
\end{equation}

\section{Final PDF file}%3

The final format in which the papers will appear in the Proceedings will be 
a PDF file. Authors are requested to send a PDF file of their final paper to 
be included directly in the Proceedings. Do not lock your PDF file~-- this 
may result in your paper not being published. 

\section{Submission of the full paper}%4

Your full paper should be submitted online via the conference website. It 
should be expected that after your submission, your final paper will be 
published directly from the PDF you send without any further proof-reading. 
Therefore, it is advisable for the authors to print a hard copy of their 
final version and read it carefully.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

The acknowledgement for funding organisations etc. should be placed in a 
separate section at the end of the text.

Thank you for your cooperation in complying with these instructions.
